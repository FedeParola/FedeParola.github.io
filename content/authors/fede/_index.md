I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Torino, Italy, sponsored by TIM S.p.A.
I obtained both my BSc and MSc (cum laude) in Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Torino.

My reasearch focuses on high performance packet processing, with particular attention to the XDP and AF_XDP technolgies powered by eBPF and the Linux kernel.
