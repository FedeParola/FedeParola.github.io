I am a research assistant at Politecnico di Torino, where I work on high-performance packet processing, kernel and user-space networking and efficient resource virtualization.

I achieved my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Torino, Italy, in July 2024.
I obtained both my BSc and MSc (cum laude) in Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Torino.

My main interests include the Linux kernel, with a focus on the networking and eBPF subsystems, high-performance packet processing through frameworks such as DPDK, and virtualization of resources through VMs, containers and novel paradigms such as serverless and unikernels.
