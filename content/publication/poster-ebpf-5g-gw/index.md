abstract: In this poster we propose the first proof-of-concept open-source implementation of a 5G Mobile Gateway based on eBPF/XDP and present benchmarks that compare its performance with alternative technologies. We show how it outperforms other in-kernel solutions (e.g., OvS) and is comparable with DPDK-based platforms.
