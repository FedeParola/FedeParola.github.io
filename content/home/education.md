    description: '**Thesis:** Orchestrating Edge Computing Services with Eï¬€icient Data Planes<br>
                  **Supervisor:** Prof. Fulvio Risso<br>
                  During my Ph.D., sponsored by TIM S.p.A., I focused on enabling high-performance and low-overhead communication between application modules and the end users, as well as providing effective mechanisms to share resources in data centers (with a focus on edge ones).
                  To reach these goals I dug into the foundations of the Linux kernel, leveraged high-performance packet processing frameworks, such as XDP
                  (powered by eBPF) and DPDK, and studied the possible evolutions of virtualization mechanisms (VMs and containers), such as Unikernels.
                  During the programme I carried out projects in collaboration with TIM S.p.A, Rakuten Mobile, and Huawei Technologies.'
