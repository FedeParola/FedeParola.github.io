    description: 'I worked under the supervision of Prof. K. K. Ramakrishnan on the design and development of a novel virtualization mechanism combining low resource footprint, strong isolation and security, high-performance data plane, and low overhead service management.
    During this period I had the opportunity to dig into the details and leverage hardware-assisted virtualization mechanisms (e.g., Intel VMX) and explore novel operating system paradigms such as Unikernels.'
