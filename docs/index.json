In fact, its capability to scale with the number of available CPU cores is limited, even in the presence of a software architecture that is intrinsically parallel. In this paper we investigate the multi-core scalability properties of WireGuard, identifying current limitations and proposing an improved design that aids effective scaling, reaching a near-linear throughput increase depending on the number of involved CPU cores. Furthermore, we propose a multi-tunnel approach to parallelize stages of the WireGuard pipeline limited to a single core per tunnel and propose a modified architecture tailored to multi-tunnel support. This architecture shows an almost 2x performance improvement over a multi-tunnel deployment of vanilla WireGuard, and supports 18x times the throughput of a single tunnel setup on our machines.","tags":["WireGuard","Tunneling","Multi-core scalability"],"title":"Achieving Linear CPU Scaling in WireGuard with an Efficient Multi-tunnel Architecture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anvaya B.

TCP/IP-based networking still plays a dominant role in data center networking to support a wide range of Layer-4 and Layer-7 applications, such as middleboxes and cloud-based microservices. However, traditional kernel-based TCP/IP stacks face performance challenges due to overheads such as context switching, interrupts, and copying. We present Z-stack, a high-performance userspace TCP/IP stack with a zero-copy design. Utilizing DPDK’s Poll Mode Driver, Z-stack bypasses the kernel and moves packets between the NIC and the protocol stack in userspace, eliminating the overhead associated with kernel-based processing. Z-stack employs polling-based packet processing that improves performance under high loads, and eliminates receive livelocks compared to interrupt-driven packet processing. With its zero-copy socket design, Z-stack eliminates copies when moving data between the user application and the protocol stack, which further minimizes latency and improves throughput. In addition, Z-stack seamlessly integrates with shared memory processing within the node, eliminating duplicate protocol processing and serialization/deserialization overheads for intra-node communication. Z-stack uses F-stack as the starting point which integrates the proven TCP/IP stack from FreeBSD, providing a versatile solution for a variety of cloud use cases and improving performance of data center networking.","tags":["DPDK","zero-copy","TCP/IP protocol stack","shared memory"],"title":"Z-Stack: A High-Performance DPDK-Based Zero-Copy TCP/IP Protocol Stack","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Davide Miola","Fulvio Risso","Federico Parola"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1719187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719187200,"objectID":"9b930f76a7de7671f677bd8ea495a223","permalink":"https://fedeperola.github.io/publication/netto/","publishdate":"2024-06-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/netto/","section":"publication","summary":"As network interfaces in the data center get faster and faster, and an increasingly big portion of the services is implemented in software, we must wonder just how much time our servers’ CPUs are spending handling network traffic.

However, the high performance provided by commonly used technologies for data plane processing such as DPDK, based on kernel-bypass primitives, comes at the cost of rigid resource partitioning. This is unsuitable for edge data centers, in which efficiency demands both general-purpose applications and data-plane telco workloads to be executed on the same (shared) physical machines. In this respect, eBPF/XDP looks a more appealing solution, thanks to its capability to process packets in the kernel, achieving a higher level of integration with non-data plane applications albeit with lower performance than DPDK. In this paper we leverage the recent introduction of AF\\_XDP, an XDP-based technology that allows to efficiently steer packets in user space, to provide a thorough comparison of user space vs in-kernel packet processing in typical scenarios of a data center at the edge of the network. Our results provide useful insights on how to select and combine these technologies in order to improve overall throughput and optimize resource usage.","tags":["Data Plane","XDP","AF_XDP","eBPF","NFV","Linux Kernel"],"title":"Comparing User Space and In-Kernel Packet Processing for Edge Data Centers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Monaco","Giuseppe Ognibene","Federico Parola","Fulvio Risso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1668384000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668384000,"objectID":"5d1c0e9a5406e5ef782ff02a586671ec","permalink":"https://fedeperola.github.io/publication/ebpf-sfcs/","publishdate":"2022-11-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ebpf-sfcs/","section":"publication","summary":"Service Function Chains (SFCs) are composed of an ordered set of Network Functions (NFs) that provide network services to the handled traffic. However, traffic is highly variable over time, thus telco operators need to deploy scalable chains that can quickly and easily adapt to the load fluctuations. Although Kubernetes has already brought benefits in terms of increased scalability and flexibility to general-purpose applications, it is not natively suitable for network workloads since it lacks some functionalities required by network services. This paper presents a simple, cloud-native architecture that integrates SFCs in Kubernetes, with the aim of seamlessly leveraging cloud-native features such as horizontal autoscaling. The solution is based on flexible cross-connections, namely logical links that connect adjacent network functions, which can promptly adapt the distribution of the network traffic to the existing network functions in case of scale in/out events affecting the number of NF instances. The architecture has been validated with an open-source proof-of-concept implementation based on dedicated Kubernetes operators and an eBPF load balancer, demonstrating the feasibility and the efficiency of the proposed approach.","tags":["Kubernetes","NFV","Service Function Chaining","eBPF"],"title":"Enabling Scalable SFCs in Kubernetes with eBPF-based Cross-Connections","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Parola","Leonardo Di Giovanna","Giuseppe Ognibene","Fulvio Risso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654041600,"objectID":"e8a299470870babaf31582c341508505","permalink":"https://fedeperola.github.io/publication/k8s-cni/","publishdate":"2022-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/k8s-cni/","section":"publication","summary":"The eBPF technology enables the creation of custom and highly efficient network services, running in the Linux kernel, tailored to the precise use case under consideration. However, the most prominent examples of such network services in eBPF follow a monolithic approach, in which all required code is created within the same program block. This makes the code hard to maintain, to extend, and difficult to reuse in other use cases. This paper leverages the Polycube framework to demonstrate that a disaggregated approach is feasible also with eBPF, with minimal overhead, introducing a larger degree of code reusability.
