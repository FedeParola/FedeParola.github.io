However, the high performance provided by commonly used technologies for data plane processing such as DPDK, based on kernel-bypass primitives, comes at the cost of rigid resource partitioning. This is unsuitable for edge data centers, in which efficiency demands both general-purpose applications and data-plane telco workloads to be executed on the same (shared) physical machines. In this respect, eBPF/XDP looks a more appealing solution, thanks to its capability to process packets in the kernel, achieving a higher level of integration with non-data plane applications albeit with lower performance than DPDK. In this paper we leverage the recent introduction of AF\\_XDP, an XDP-based technology that allows to efficiently steer packets in user space, to provide a thorough comparison of user space vs in-kernel packet processing in typical scenarios of a data center at the edge of the network. Our results provide useful insights on how to select and combine these technologies in order to improve overall throughput and optimize resource usage.","tags":["Data Plane","XDP","AF_XDP","eBPF","NFV","Linux Kernel"],"title":"Comparing User Space and In-Kernel Packet Processing for Edge Data Centers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Parola","Leonardo Di Giovanna","Giuseppe Ognibene","Fulvio Risso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654041600,"objectID":"e8a299470870babaf31582c341508505","permalink":"https://fedeperola.github.io/publication/k8s-cni/","publishdate":"2022-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/k8s-cni/","section":"publication","summary":"The eBPF technology enables the creation of custom and highly efficient network services, running in the Linux kernel, tailored to the precise use case under consideration. However, the most prominent examples of such network services in eBPF follow a monolithic approach, in which all required code is created within the same program block. This makes the code hard to maintain, to extend, and difficult to reuse in other use cases. This paper leverages the Polycube framework to demonstrate that a disaggregated approach is feasible also with eBPF, with minimal overhead, introducing a larger degree of code reusability. This paper considers a complex network scenario, such as a complete network provider for Kubernetes, presenting the resulting architecture and a preliminary performance evaluation.","tags":["Kubernetes","eBPF","NFV"],"title":"Creating Disaggregated Network Services with eBPF: the Kubernetes Network Provider Use Case","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Parola","Roberto Procopio","Fulvio Risso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638316800,"objectID":"95df21e684b85b3d8a85d6477a9b6683","permalink":"https://fedeperola.github.io/publication/poster-xdp-perf/","publishdate":"2021-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/poster-xdp-perf/","section":"publication","summary":"While servers in traditional data centers can be specialized to run either CPU-intensive or network-intensive workloads, edge data centers need to consolidate both on the same machine(s) due to the reduced number of servers.

Unfortunately, this is not always possible when running at the edge of the network, in which a few servers are available in each cluster and a mixture of data and control plane services must coexist on the same hardware. In this respect, eBPF can become a better alternative thanks to its integration in the vanilla Linux kernel, which enables contemporary support for data and control plane services, hence enabling a more efficient usage of the (scarce) computing resources. This paper proposes the first proof-of-concept open-source implementation of a 5G Mobile Gateway based on eBPF/XDP, highlighting the possible challenges (e.g., to create traffic policers, as buffering is not available in eBPF) and the resulting architecture. The result is characterized in terms of performance and scalability and compared with alternative technologies, showing that it outperforms other in-kernel solutions (e.g., Open vSwitch) and is comparable with DPDK-based platforms.","tags":["Network Functions","eBPF","XDP","5G Mobile Gateway","5G User Plane Function"],"title":"Providing Telco-oriented Network Services with eBPF: the Case for a 5G Mobile Gateway","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Parola","Sebastiano Miano","Fulvio Risso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596240000,"objectID":"d9294e8cf063d70d70cc3f1c4627fd6a","permalink":"https://fedeperola.github.io/publication/poster-ebpf-5g-gw/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/poster-ebpf-5g-gw/","section":"publication","summary":"In this poster we propose the first proof-of-concept open-source implementation of a 5G Mobile Gateway based on eBPF/XDP and present benchmarks that compare its performance with alternative technologies.
