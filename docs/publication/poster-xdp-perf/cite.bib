  abstract = {While servers in traditional data centers can be specialized to run either CPU-intensive or network-intensive workloads, edge data centers need to consolidate both on the same machine(s) due to the reduced number of servers. This paper presents some preliminary experiments to determine how to improve the overall throughput of the above servers, being XDP and AF_XDP the two main technologies into play.},
